               <p>I love weightlifting and staying active. It’s a big part of my life, even though I don’t have photos to share of my routines. My passion for fitness extends to enjoying outdoor activities like camping and hiking, which keep me grounded and connected to nature.</p>

               <p>Staying mentally balanced and continuously learning are core parts of my life. I find solace in nature, like admiring the beauty of flowers, and I believe that growth comes from challenging yourself with new knowledge and experiences.</p>
