                    <p>During my time at Blizzard, I felt I learned the most I've ever learned in my life. I learned not only so much about coding but also living alone in a new state, adapting to new driving habits, trying new foods, meeting new people, and so much more.
                          I am genuinely so grateful to have had this experience and on top of that just learn so much more about softare engineering and learning from senior developers.<br>
                         Focusing on the technical side of things, I was tasked with moving our current system of sending builds out internally for testing --into a more efficient and straightforward method. I accomplished this with the use of automating calls with the use of Jenkins as well as Google Cloud Functions and AWSS3 buckets.
                          I learned a great deal about GCP as well as Jenkins and Groovy which Jenkins uses.  </p>

                         During my time at Lockheed Martin, it was definitely a wild ride. I got the internship right out of high school barely knowing any kind of coding or having any experience with computers.
                         For the first 2 years, I definitely was one of the less experienced interns there with many having a couple years of coding experience already. It was such a fun experience and I got to present to members of the government
                         and high leveled VPs. I also made a couple friends and made really good memories with the other interns.

                    <p>Year 1: <br>
                    Designed and developed the user interface for an iPad application that incorporated Augmented Reality (AR) and supported concepts of Generative Design.
                    Gained foundational experience in UI/UX development and AR integration while collaborating with a multidisciplinary team.
                    <br>
                    Year 2:
                    <br>
                    Collaborated with a full-time team to implement new features for an in-house application designed to assist in creating presentations and demonstrations for a proprietary three-screen device.
                    Leveraged Unity to develop and enhance functionalities, ensuring seamless user experiences during client-facing presentations.
                    <br>
                    Year 3:
                    <br>
                    Contributed to an end-to-end proof-of-concept project aimed at firefighting solutions. This included gathering and displaying real-time weather data and location information on both a website and an AR-enabled HoloLens headset.
                    Designed the solution to aid firefighters by providing critical, actionable data in a user-friendly interface.
                    Delivered the concept as part of a broader innovation initiative to present advanced firefighting technologies.</p>
